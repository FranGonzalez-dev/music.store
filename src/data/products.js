        'descripcion': "The American Professional II Jazzmaster takes the classic Fender look and jazzes it up even more. The popular deep “C” neck design now features smooth rolled fingerboard edges, a satin finish and a newly sculpted neck heel for a supremely comfortable feel along the entire fretboard. New V-Mod II Jazzmaster single-coil pickups are more articulate than ever and include a tap function that allows both a powerful, throaty sound as well as a traditional lower-output sound. The Jazzmaster American Professional II also features a new Panorama tremolo system with a pop-in tremolo arm that dramatically increases the range of vibrato available, allowing for deep, Strat-style dives, I addition to the classic Jazzmaster warble"

        'descripcion': "Over the decades, players have been continually inspired by the sound of a Strat. From the clarity of the high end, through the gut punch of the mids and the solid lows, it's a sound that's helped define what an electric guitar should be—versatile enough for any style and broad enough for any player to find an individual voice. This Player Series Stratocaster puts all of the classic features of the Strat at your fingertips while adding a modern edge, including a bridge position humbucker and freshly redesigned 2-point fulcrum vibrato bridge. With a solid alder body, and a 22-fret maple fingerboard with a contemporary 9.5' radius for easy bending, the Player Series Stratocaster HSS is primed and ready to carry you along your musical voyage."

Guitar Player called it the best. Plug it in. Crank it up. You'll hear what all the fuss is about. Tone, drive, and level controls."

        'descripcion': "The V847A Wah-Wah pedal is an enhanced version of the most famous guitar effects pedal of all time. Based on the specifications of the original pedal developed by VOX in the '60s, this version offers guitarists the same legendary tone with the addition of AC power capability and a buffered input jack for preserving the unprocessed guitar tone when the pedal is not engaged. The pedal's inductor has undergone a redesign to be closer in specification to the original VOX wah inductors, for improved dynamics and tone. These additions will benefit players of all genres who use a wah pedal as an integral part of their sound."
